### Blueprint [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hrs/blueprint.png?branch=master&.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hrs/blueprint)

A simple little Scheme implemented in Ruby.

Blueprint is still very tiny and missing a ton of functionality. This
is just for fun.

To fire up a REPL:

```sh
$ bin/run_repl
> (+ 1 2 3)
6
>
```

To run the tests:

```sh
$ rspec
```
